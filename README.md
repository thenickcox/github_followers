# github_followers
View your GitHub followers from the comfort of the command line

# What is this?
It's a simple command line application that, given a GitHub username, returns a list of followers. (The first 30, anyway.)

# Why?
This is my first project in Go to explore the language. It was the smallest application that involved JSON parsing (a task I knew I'd be doing a lot of) and did something (arguably) useful.

# Usage

With Go installed, Run `$ ./github_followers <your_user_name>` from the directory where this repo is cloned, or add it to your `$PATH` and run it from anywhere.

Example

```
$ ./github_followers thenickcox                                                                                                       !17777
